            <h2>How We Make It Possible</h2>
            <p><strong class="underline">Expertise - Energy Consultant</strong></p>
            <p>Tavas aims at working with non-profit organizations engaged in public and community service, to reduce & offset their carbon footprint through efficient management of their energy consumption and emissions by installing self sustaining green energy alternatives.</p>
            <p>Here is a step-by-step guide as to how this is made possible:</p>
            <p><strong>Identify Needs:</strong></p>
            <p>We help organizations and communities to be self reliant for their energy requirements by funding and supporting them on their path to energy independence through alternative energy source installations. Our experts analyze consumption patterns before recommending the best energy solution fit. Alternate energy solution options may include wind, solar or geo-thermal energy sources.</p>
            <p><strong>Approach Retailers/Manufacturers:</strong></p>
            <p>Best bids are selected through responses to Request For Proposals in the local market. Vendors participating in the Request For Proposals process are considered only after extensive research on company background, company reputation, cost factors, infrastructure, referrals, and reliability. Tavas works with each manufacturer and retailer to ensure best pricing for our valued customers.</p>
            <p><strong>Fund Projects:</strong></p>
            <p>Tavas helps its clients to fund their energy installation projects through voluntary and government based grants. Based on individual installations, partial to full funding may be obtained. Tavas will design a program to reduce your energy costs while greatly reducing your greenhouse gas emissions, as outlined below:</p>
