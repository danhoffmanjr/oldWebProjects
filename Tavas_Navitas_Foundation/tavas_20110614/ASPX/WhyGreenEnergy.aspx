            <h2>Why Green Energy</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>The Industrial revolution in the 21st century has heralded an era of unprecedented technological develop-<br />ments that have led to advanced global economies, affecting the human equation in innumerable ways. While technology has had a major impact, energy producing fossil fuels have played the role of being the backbone for successful implementation of our ideas and technologies. While these advances have essentially led to life altering changes in many spheres and the entire human race has benefited from the same, our actions have also resulted in subsequent detriment to our life-sustaining planet. We can no longer afford to ignore the fact that in the past century, our way of life has resulted in depletion of the earth's natural resources, increased pollution, global warming and potential health hazards. It's time we rely on our ability to find solutions to problems and turn this situation around before it is too late.</p>
            <p>No single solution can meet our society's future energy needs. 'Green Energy', as the technology is often referred to, is one of the many technological avenues that has the potential to address this growing global issue, in an effective and balanced manner. Green Energy is any energy that is derived from naturally replenished sources and does not negatively impact the environment significantly. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines green power as electricity produced from solar, wind, geothermal, biogas, biomass, and low-impact small hydroelectric sources.</p>
            <p><strong class="underline">Solar Energy:</strong> Solar Energy refers to a wide range of technologies that harness and convert the sun's radiant and inexhaustible energy to a usable form of energy. Currently, only a miniscule fraction of available solar energy is effectively used. Obvious uses of solar technology include heating and lighting our residential and commercial buildings.</p>
            <p><strong class="underline">Wind Energy:</strong> Wind Energy is a form of solar energy, since winds are produced due to uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun, earth's surface irregularities and rotation of the earth. Wind Energy refers to converting wind to generate mechanical or electrical power. Wind energy is one of the most cost effective and abundant sources of energy. One of the most popular mechanisms of generating wind energy is through the use of wind turbines.</p>
            <p><strong class="underline">Geothermal Energy:</strong> Geothermal energy refers to capturing and converting the heat from the earth to electricity. Earth's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet, from radioactive decay of minerals, from volcanic activity, and from solar energy absorbed at the surface. Geothermal power is clean, economical, sustainable and environment friendly.</p>
            <p><strong class="underline">Biogas Energy:</strong> Biogas energy refers to mechanisms used to derive energy from gases produced by the biological breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen. Biogas is a renewable energy source and is a low cost fossil fuel alternative.</p>
            <p><strong class="underline">Biomass Energy:</strong> Biomass energy refers to generating energy from plant material and animal waste. This is the oldest source of renewable energy source.</p>
            <p><strong class="underline">Facts About Climate Change:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Average global temperatures increased by about 1 degree Fahrenheit over the 20th century.</li>
                <li>The United States contains only 5% of the world's population, but contributes to 22% of the world's carbon emissions.</li>
                <li>15% of carbon emissions come from deforestation and land use change.</li>
                <li>The Golden Toad (<em>Bufo periglenes</em>) is thought to be the first species to go extinct because of climate change.</li>
                <li>Personal cars and trucks in the United States emit 20% of the United States' carbon emissions.</li>
                <li>Air conditioning and heating accounts for almost half of electricity usage in the average American home.</li>
                <li>Climate change is linked to stronger hurricanes, more drought and increased coral deaths from bleaching.</li>
                <li>Climate change is linked to an increase in disease-carrying pests that lead to the increased spread of diseases such as Dengue fever, Malaria, Lyme disease and West Nile virus.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong class="underline">Facts About Coal Plants:</strong></p>
            <p>A typical 500-megawatt coal plant produces 3.5 billion kilowatt-hours per year &ndash; enough to power a city of about 140,000 people.</p>
            <p>It burns 1.4 million tons of coal (the equivalent of 40 train cars of coal each day) and uses 2.2 billion gallons of water each year. In an average year, this one plant also generates the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>10,000 tons of sulfur dioxide</li>
                <li>10,200 tons of nitrogen oxide, equivalent to half a million late-model cars</li>
                <li>3.7 million tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to cutting down 100 million trees</li>
                <li>500 tons of small particles</li>
                <li>220 tons of hydrocarbons</li>
                <li>720 tons of carbon monoxide</li>
                <li>125,000 tons of ash and 193,000 tons of sludge from the smokestack scrubber</li>
                <li>170 pounds of mercury</li>
                <li>225 pounds of arsenic</li>
                <li>114 pounds of lead</li>
                <li>4 pounds of cadmium</li>
                <li>Other toxic heavy metals and trace amounts of Uranium</li>
            </ul>
