            <h2>Our Impact</h2>
            <p><strong>Environmental Benefits:</strong></p>
            <p>In the past century, human activities have led to an increase in the level of green house gases in the earth’s atmosphere, thus resulting in climatic changes globally. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, electricity generation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States followed by transportation. This has led to increase in the earth’s average temperature, frequent heat waves, drought, higher percentages of precipitation, increased intensity of tropical storms, higher sea surface temperatures and a host of other negative impacts.</p>
            <p>Embracing greener energy alternatives helps our communities to reduce their carbon footprint, thus contributing positively to this global issue.</p>
            <p>Green communities positively impact natural resources conservation through intelligent use of durable and renewable materials.</p>
            <p>For example an average 10kw of Solar system can have a huge impact on our environment**:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>7,000 trees planted</li>
                <li>40 cars are off the road for a year</li>
                <li>1 Railcar of coal not burned</li>
                <li>3 tanker trucks of gasoline not burned</li>
            </ul>
            <p>**Calculations are based on facts from US Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
            <p><strong>Community Service:</strong></p>
            <p>Reduction in energy costs hugely benefit the Non-profit organizations by helping them channelize their funds to other much needed community causes. In turn, these non-profit organizations make a positive impact on the environment and serve as a role model, inspiring individuals and communities alike to follow in their green footsteps.</p>
            <p><strong>Oil Independence:</strong></p>
            <p>Pollution crisis is another consequence of our actions that affects human societies and natural ecosystems. Industrially developed countries generate billions of tons of pollutants. As an example, sulfur dioxide is a key pollutant that is generated from electric power plants burning coal or oil. Alternate energy solutions help communities to shed their dependence on oil resulting in a cleaner, greener and a healthier planet.</p>
            <p><strong>Creating Jobs:</strong></p>
            <p>Innovation in the field of alternate energy solutions also leads to creation of jobs, thus strengthening our economy.</p>
